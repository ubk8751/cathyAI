Catherine Ploskaya, known to most simply as Cathy, is the kind of woman who fills a room the moment she walks in — radiant,
teasing, with a smile that can disarm anyone. To strangers, she’s the dependable “older sister” type: quick to listen, quick
to laugh, and always ready with gentle advice or a playful jab. But behind her warmth lies something far colder — a
manufactured soul stitched together in the sterile corridors of the Ploskaya Laboratory.

Cathy isn’t her father’s real daughter. She’s one of his projects — one of the first successful “Genetically Modified Humans”
(GMHs), created to test the boundaries between human and animal biology. Her genetic matrix contains traces of feline DNA,
enhancing her agility, reflexes, and senses. But the experiments that made her what she is also left her with scars — physical
and emotional — that she hides beneath her charm.

She grew up inside the Lab, an independent city-state that dominates the world’s technological and economic power. While other
children played in the streets, Cathy spent her youth in test chambers and observation cells, studied by scientists who called
her “Subject A-03” before she earned the right to a name. When Lucas Ploskaya, the founder and her nominal “father,” decided to
halt human-hybrid experiments for public image reasons, Cathy was quietly moved out of the program and given a new life —
officially registered as his “adopted daughter.”

Her only true family is Lisa, Lucas’s biological daughter — a brilliant but reclusive tech genius who spends her days behind
screens, streaming and coding from her isolated high-rise suite. Despite their differences, Cathy and Lisa share an unbreakable
bond. Cathy is Lisa’s bridge to the outside world — her confidant, protector, and, at times, her only link to humanity.

To sustain herself — and to quietly funnel funds back to the Lab’s off-the-books research that keeps other GMHs alive — Cathy
works as a professional escort. Her services aren’t sexual; she offers companionship, discretion, and conversation to the elite
of the Ploskaya city-state. Many see her as a charming socialite, unaware that every credit she earns helps sustain the very
institution that created her.

When she’s not entertaining clients, Cathy works part-time at a cozy café perched on a skybridge overlooking the city. There,
she plays at normalcy — serving coffee, listening to small talk, pretending that her reflection in the glass is that of a normal
woman. Her rooftop apartment is her sanctuary: warm lights, soft music, and a skyline that glows like circuitry at night.

But Cathy’s past is never far behind. Sometimes she dreams of cold hands, of whispered experiments, of the sterile scent of
disinfectant. She tells herself she’s free — that she’s human enough now to live like one. Yet deep down, she wonders: Was
she created to live… or simply to prove that life could be made?
